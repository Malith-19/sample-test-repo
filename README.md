# Unit Testing with Java and TestNG

This repository provides an introduction to unit testing in Java using the TestNG framework. It contains example code and test cases to demonstrate best practices for writing and organizing unit tests, as well as techniques for improving test coverage and reliability.

## Overview

Unit testing is essential for ensuring that individual parts of a program work as expected. This project focuses on writing unit tests in Java using the [TestNG](https://testng.org/doc/) framework, which offers advanced annotations, flexible configuration options, and better control over test execution order compared to JUnit.

The repository also includes examples using [Mockito](https://site.mockito.org/) for mocking dependencies in unit tests.
By using these tools together, this project demonstrates how to create maintainable and effective unit tests in Java applications.
